My project is "Writting a Python program to covert tempratures"

In this project I would like to learn how to use python programming language to convert the tempratures.
There are about 5 major temperature scales are used in world. Among them,the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are mostly used in our daily life,
and the Kelvin and Rankine scales are mostly used in industry and science.
I would like to practise the convesion among  Celsius, Fahrenheit and Rankine. 

The orignal material and code source are from 
the unittest modual is a part of  python library. After import to the computer, it can use the function assert to test some software.
The formula to convert from degrees Celsius (C) to to degrees Kelvin (k) is:

Celsius to Kelvin formula: oK = oC +273.15
Kelvin to Celsius formula: oC = oK - 273.15 (oK 0 degree == -273.15 oC---absolute temprature)

The formula to convert from degrees Rankine (Ra) to degrees Celsius (C) is:ankine
Rankine (Ra) to Celsius formula: oC = Ra/1.8 -

The formula to convert from degrees Celsius (C) to to degrees Fahrenheit (F) is:
Celsius to Fahrenheit formula: oF = oC * 1.8 + 32,
Fahenheit to Celsius formula : oC = (oF-32)/1.8,
I would first to practise with a assumed temperature mesurement to do the conversion and then will extend the script to any number of the temprature measurement.
